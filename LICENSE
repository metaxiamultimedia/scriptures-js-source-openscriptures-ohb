MODIFICATIONS FROM ORIGINAL DATA

This package processes the original MorphHB data as follows:
- Converted from OSIS XML to JSON format
- Restructured into per-verse files organized by book/chapter
- Standardized word structure with position, text, lemma, morph, strongs fields
- Cantillation marks (Hebrew: טעמים) are preserved in the text
- Qere/Ketiv textual variants are flagged with a `variant` field ('ketiv' or 'qere')
- Strong's numbers extracted and normalized to array format (e.g., ["H1234"])

Gematria values are NOT pre-computed in the stored data; they are computed
on-demand by the scriptures-core library when accessed.
